# Mario Kart Experience with Hololens and Arduino-controlled Robotic Car

## Overview
The Mario Kart Experience project combines the power of Microsoft Hololens mixed reality headset, Vuforia augmented reality platform, and an Arduino-controlled robotic car to create an immersive and interactive Mario Kart-inspired experience. This project aims to bring the thrill of the popular racing game into the real world by allowing users to navigate a physical racetrack while viewing virtual elements through the Hololens headset.

Using the Microsoft Hololens mixed reality headset, users can see the physical racetrack in front of them and virtual elements seamlessly overlaid onto the environment. Vuforia augmented reality platform enables track detection and visualization, ensuring that the virtual elements align precisely with the physical track. The Arduino-controlled robotic car, equipped with sensors for track detection and navigation, allows users to control their own Mario Kart-like vehicle and compete in thrilling races against other players.

## Features
- Real-time integration of Hololens mixed reality and Arduino-controlled robotic car.
- Track detection and visualization using Vuforia augmented reality platform.
- Virtual elements overlaid on the physical racetrack.
- Interactive gameplay with gesture recognition and voice commands.
- Arduino control of the robotic car for precise movement and control.
- Multiplayer functionality TBD for competitive racing experiences.

## Requirements
- Microsoft Hololens mixed reality headset
- Vuforia augmented reality platform
- Arduino-based robotic car with motor control
- Sensors for track detection and navigation
- Hololens development environment (Unity, Visual Studio, etc.)
- Arduino development environment (Arduino IDE)
- Required libraries for Hololens and Arduino development

## Usage
1. Set up the physical racetrack with appropriate markings and sensors for track detection.
2. Connect the Arduino-controlled robotic car to your computer for programming and control.
3. Install and set up the Hololens development environment (Unity, Visual Studio) on your computer.
4. Install the required libraries for Hololens development and Vuforia augmented reality platform.
5. Create a Unity project and import the necessary assets for the Mario Kart Experience.
6. Develop the virtual Mario Kart elements and track visualization using Vuforia and Unity.
7. Program the Arduino to receive control commands from the Hololens application and control the robotic car's movements accordingly.
8. Build and deploy the Hololens application to your Hololens device.
9. Wear the Hololens headset, start the application, and experience the Mario Kart-inspired gameplay on the physical racetrack.
